            Facts on global warming <br>
          </h1>
          <p>
            It is a secret for no one: Hearth is getting warmer, and this situation jeopardizes the ecosystems that made it up.<br>
            Even though the source of this global warming is not unique, most of the scientific studies agree on the fact that humanity is one of its main actors.
            <br>

            <br>
            We are facing a demographic growth since the second part of the 20th century. <br>
            This increase and the massive industrialization of our environment have led us to an explosion of the greenhouse gases emission. <br>
            Among them, we can find the CO2 which essentially comes from the combustion of fossil fuels.
            <br>

            <br>
            Through the following graphs, we offer you to see this global warming just as the emissions of CO2 of several countries all around the world. <br>
            The choice of the nation presented, even though it is partly arbitrary, tend to reflect the situation of the different regions of the globe. <br>
            Every continent is shown, and developed countries are as represented as developing ones.

                </h2>

                <p>
                  Look at this heatmap! We can see the temperature variations over a period that goes from 1900 to 2020. <br>
                  The reference which is used is the mean of the variations between 1951 and 1980 for the country selected. <br>
                  Each line corresponds to a nation and are ordered by the mean temperature variation over the temporal interval observed. <br>
                  You will find the countries that have suffered from the most extreme variations at the top of the graph. Hover a square for further precision!    
                  <br>

                  <br>
                  By clicking on a line, you will also have access to a line chart presenting the monthly minimal and maximal variations of the selected country. <br>
                  The line chart can be seen right under the heatmap <br>
                  How must one understand the visualization? For each month of the year, the mean variation is calculated. <br> 
                  Thanks to this graph, you will find the one with the highest variation on the red curve and the one with the lowest on the blue curve! <br>
                  The black curve in the middle allows you to precisely locate the annual mean.

                Do you remember the CO2 emissions we talk about before? <br> 
                This bar chart shows their evolution on a global scale between 1960 and 2016. <br>
                In the manner of the first visualization, the color represents the temperature variations with 1960 as the year of reference. <br>
                A simple click on one of the bars allows you to change this reference while hovering will give you the accurate values.

                This new visualization offers you to have a point of comparison between the CO2 <br>

                You can also use the +1/-1 or +10/-10 buttons to explore by yourself.

                Have you seen some circles turning to green? It means that at some point, <br>
                the country has taken a strong action (or measure) to fight against greenhouse gas emissions with, <br>
                for instance, a carbon tax.

                Do you want to focus on the route of a country through the overall period? <br>

                The more opaque a point is, the more recent the data is.

                <p>
                  Our last visualization intends to show if the temperature variations of a country has any impact on the actions taken by a country. <br>
                  Each circle represent a country. <br>
                  The red rectangle gathers all countries that have not taken any measure yet but as soon as they do, they transfert to the green rectangle. <br>
                  The position on the vertical axis of a circle represents the temperature variation. <br>
                  So what one wants to do is to see if the circles tend to switch from the red rectangle to the green rectangle when they are at a high temperature variation.
